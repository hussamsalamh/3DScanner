Note :
    we can set up the leaser to which color we need,
    so we will choose the blue leaser in order to increase the contrast of RGB
    we will use black screen in order for threshold to be more correct and little noise in image
    in the black screen will be white mark that show the straight line


First we need a class for : -> we can implement it later

    stepMotor in order to swap/rotate the surface (can )




class : for video in order to divide to frame
class : for extract all the information from the image -> will take the image

        processImage(image ) -> will return clean image
        findStraightLine(image: array[array] ) -> will find the location of straight line
        divideLine( matrix : array[array]]) -> divide the straight line for dl return the value of this pixel in matrix
            in order to calculate the slope ( to generate the next point )

        calculateDisplacement(prevPoint : int , pixelValue : int ) -> calculate slope


class for the output matrix
    findNextPoint ( slope , previousPoint )     -> will generate a new point and place it in matrix




Note :

    need to make some line in paper in order to find the relationship of pixels and real life
